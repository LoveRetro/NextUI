minarch
	can I ignore shortcut combo key input when shortcut is triggered?
		eg. PAD_cancel(BTN_NAME)
		the trick is ignoring the release
	
tg_*040
	can I build my own version of SDL2 to speed up launch times?
		yes but no, built, no change in launch time :\
		currently just getting the rendering context going takes ~500ms versus ~200ms on other devices
		is it a ram speed issue?
	try to reproduce hung shutdowns and fix
		doesn't have or use a custom bin/shutdown

my355
	firmware update
		https://www.lomiyoo.com/en/gujianxiazai.html
		test + bootlogo
		
	minui can't install if
		MinUI is aleady installed on the card and the tmp_update hook has already been installed previously
		solution
			delete .tmp_update and reinstall
			
	undone
		+ headphone jack
			- mute is static noise (same on stock)
			- so left at 0 volume instead
		+ rumble
			- feels awful
		- hdmi
			- stock requires reboot to load hdmi dtb
			- screen turns off
			- audio stays on device?
			- almost works
				- minui launches fine
				- minarch running at 30fps
				- exiting to minui displays correctly until first dirty
					- then padding changes to 640x480 style
					- who cares
	
screen scaling + screen effect
	aspect + grid on cubexx has grid alignment issues
		even if aspect equals integer
		probably due to blindly overscaling when integer would suffice

	redo audio pipeline
		I think fceumm has issues on more devices than not at this point (thanks h700)
		400 SAMPLES fix isn't a true fix, it just minimizes the side effect
		I wonder if picarch's dynamic rate control would help here
			that seems to be a frame pacing fix, not an audio fix
		can I let SDL handle resampling (on newer hardware?)
			pass NULL for received lets SDL resample invisibly (I think)
			would that even help?
		what about SDL_AudioStream? (added 2.0.7)
			https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Tutorials-AudioStream
			what if the changes to make audio stream public
			in SDL2 is what introduced the issue? :sweat_smile:

	
	clean out this rat nest of a todo doc

	all
		look into how many cores support 8888
			this might be a bottleneck (if it's having to go 8888 to 565 and back to 8888 for every pixel, every frame)
			not a single BASE or EXTRA core requests 8888, so that won't help even if it is a bottleneck
					
		look into RETRO_ENVIRONMENT_GET_CURRENT_SOFTWARE_FRAMEBUFFER for zero copy framebuffer
			not sure it's really a zero copy because LockTexture has to copy the texture from the gpu to the cpu...
			
			times on a30's SDL
				GB: SDL_UnlockTexture blocked for 3ms (160,144) (TLOZ:LA)
				PS: SDL_UnlockTexture blocked for 5ms (368,480) (TEKKEN3)
				PS: SDL_UnlockTexture blocked for 8ms (512,480) (BR2)
				PS: SDL_UnlockTexture blocked for 11ms (640,480) (CMR2)
				try using SDL_UpdateTexture instead of Lock/Unlock
					might be saving 1-2ms
				could this slowness be related to vram speed? (DMC?)

	pretty sure nothing uses the various platform.h BUTTON_* macros (because SDLK_* mappings are so spotty on these devices)
		pretty sure they all use CODE_* or JOY_* now
	
	all
		evtest
			random note: doesn't know about /dev/input/js0?
		standarize /bin/shutdown
			while (1) pause(); prevents shutdown on some platforms
			just system("rm /tmp/minui_exec") and exit(0) ?
		
		collections can't handle accented characters (eg. é) in path/rom name...
			wait, why can recents.txt but not collections.txt?
			because one is written by the device so it's using device native accented chars
		update stored rom path logic to only require TAG and not full folder name? (would simplify Collection authoring?)
		add make fetch to get all external sources before build?
		add Developer.pak
			only for devices with adb or ssh
			
		rewrite Shortcuts section of readme by device not the tangled mess it currently is
			maybe do the same for all?
			break out platforms into completely separate installers/updaters?
				will require revisiting unzipping system
				will need to inject not replace
					but then how to handle removing deleted files?
					seems like this is what currently happens on some (all?) platforms
		look into mednafen/beetle ngp core (neopop?)
			beetle-ngp-libretro
			this ran at about 1 frame per 10 seconds...on rgb30
			add logging
		wonderswan
			runs at 1fps
			possibly because minarch forces 60fps but this handheld runs at 75?
			
	tg5040						
		n64
			requires libretro opengl implementation
		psp
			after adding xrgb8888 support to MinUI it still chokes on a number of missing libraries 
			and eventually an unlinked function (something like XUnlockMutex)
	
	minarch:
		crop save state pillar/letter-boxing?
		force aspect over hdmi? (or at least disable cropped?)

all
	minarch
		GFX_blitMessage() screen w/h is 0,0 for some reason
		prevent MENU+button from triggering button
		prevent binding same MENU+button to control and shortcut at same time
			reset the newer input to None and show a message, ideal something like:
				MENU+<button> is already bound to (<name> shortcut|<name> control)
	main makefile
		targets have too many dependencies
		getting a little better
	cores
		add optional per core patch folder
			currently looks for a global one in all/cores
		move all the CORE_* vars up to all/cores (since they ended up all being the same)
		there has got to be a better way to main these patches
			updating fake-08 was so much copy/pasting
	minui
		alt tag is getting truncated, should be added after truncation

---

FIXME: main makefile is a brittle mess
	each platform has its own default cores and extras
	so it's a tangle
